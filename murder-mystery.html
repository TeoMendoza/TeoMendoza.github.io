            <h3>The Story</h3>
            <p>
                At its heart, this project explores the unraveling of a family bound by cult-like devotion 
                and generations of manipulation. The protagonist's life has been defined by a string of 
                suspicious tragedies, a father, mother, and brother dead, claimed 
                by overdoses, suicides, or unexplained accidents.

            </p>
            <p>
                What connects them all is the looming presence of the extended family, each member tied to 
                the events by hidden motives, rivalries, or blind loyalty. Drawn back into the family's estate, 
                you're thrust into an environment where nothing is said plainly, and every interaction carries 
                undertones of secrecy and control.

            </p>
            <p>
                Each family member, whether ambitious, broken, or complicit, becomes a piece of the puzzle 
                behind the deaths and the system that allowed them. The story builds toward a confrontation with both 
                the truth and the cost of uncovering it, where the deeper you dig, the more dangerous your own family becomes.

            <h3>The Game (Concept)</h3>
            <p><strong>Exploration & Interactables:</strong> The experience centers on exploring the family mansion: rooms,
            basements, backyards, and more. You can interact with many objects and spaces, but not everything is a clue.
            Interacting always carries risk because the household is active around you.
        </p>

            <p><strong>Gated Discovery:</strong> Clues unlock in tiers. Certain discoveries only appear after you've found
            an initial set, ensuring a baseline understanding before the story advances.
        </p>

            <p><strong>People in Motion:</strong> Family members and staff move on time-of-day schedules with semi-randomized
            path choices. If you're seen snooping or interacting in a sensitive spot, they'll stop you and ask questions.
        </p>

            <p><strong>Confrontations & Dialogue:</strong> Being caught triggers a short back-and-forth. Outcomes consider the
            character's personality, where you were, how incriminating the context is, and your dialogue choices. 
            Negative outcomes raise household awareness.
        </p>

            <p><strong>Suspicion & Strikes:</strong> Suspicion accumulates as “strikes.” Stack too many, and the next time
            you're caught snooping, you die. This creates pressure to act carefully rather than brute-force every
            interaction.
        </p>

            <p><strong>Difficulty & Respawns:</strong> On death, you respawn. Difficulty settings determine whether you
            keep discovered clues or must re-establish them, balancing approachability with stakes.
        </p>

            <p><strong>Restricted Areas & Hiding:</strong> Private spaces (e.g., bedrooms, offices) are treated as restricted: 
            being there, whether or not you're actively snooping, will trigger an immediate confrontation if someone sees you. 
            These rooms may have hiding spots, but they aren't one-button escapes; you need to clock them ahead of time and be 
            positioned within reach to slip in before you're spotted.
        </p>

            <p><strong>Sound as Information:</strong> Footsteps, voices, and doors provide directional audio cues.
            Reading the soundscape helps you decide when to end a search, relocate, or hide.
        </p>

            <p><strong>Day/Night Rhythm:</strong> The investigation spans multiple days with day/night cycles changing who
            is present and where they can be found, opening and closing windows of access.
        </p>

            <p><strong>Progression & Ending:</strong> As days pass, you piece together the truth and ultimately discover the
            bodies of your mother, your presumed father, and your brother. You're then prompted to escape. After tense,
            quiet maneuvers, a final chase erupts; you narrowly break free as the house burns with the family trapped
            inside, a tragic ending, as not everyone deserved it.</p>
