            <h3>Family Dinner</h3>
            <p>
                A narrative project exploring the unraveling of a family bound by cult-like devotion 
                and hidden motives. Created in collaboration with an artist, Family Dinner introduces 
                the story's characters, themes, and tone through worldbuilding and media concepts, 
                with an accompanying game idea built around exploration, secrecy, and discovery.

                The character art was a collaborative effort: I handled full character design and initial sketches, 
                while my collaborator brought them to life with polished versions featured in the posts.

            <h3>The Story</h3>
            <p>
                At its heart, this project explores the unraveling of a family bound by cult-like devotion 
                and generations of manipulation. The protagonist's life has been marked by a string of 
                suspicious tragedies, a father, mother, and brother lost to overdoses, suicides, or 
                unexplained accidents.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the center of it all looms the extended family, each member bound to the events by hidden 
                motives, rivalries, or blind loyalty. Drawn back into their estate, you're thrust into a world 
                where nothing is said plainly and every interaction carries undertones of secrecy and control.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each family member, whether ambitious, broken, or complicit, becomes a piece of the puzzle 
                behind the deaths and the system that allowed them. The story builds toward a confrontation with both 
                the truth and its price, where the deeper you dig, the more dangerous your own family becomes.

            <h3>The Game (Concept)</h3>

            <p><strong>Exploration & Interactables:</strong> The experience centers on exploring the family mansion: rooms,
            basements, backyards, and more. Many objects can be examined, but not everything is a clue. Interacting always 
            carries risk, as the household is active around you.</p>

            <p><strong>Gated Discovery:</strong> Clues unlock in tiers. Certain discoveries only appear after you've found
            an initial set, ensuring a baseline understanding before the story advances.</p>

            <p><strong>Moving Characters:</strong> Family members and staff follow time-of-day schedules with semi-randomized
            paths. If you're seen snooping in a sensitive spot, they'll stop you and ask questions.</p>

            <p><strong>Confrontations:</strong> Being caught triggers a short exchange. Outcomes depend on the character's 
            personality, where you were, how incriminating the context is, and your dialogue choices. Negative outcomes raise 
            household awareness.</p>

            <p><strong>Suspicion:</strong> Suspicion builds as “strikes.” Stack too many, and the next time you're caught 
            snooping, you die. This creates pressure to act carefully instead of brute-forcing every interaction.</p>

            <p><strong>Difficulty & Respawns:</strong> On death, you respawn. Difficulty settings determine whether you 
            keep discovered clues or must re-establish them, balancing accessibility with real stakes.</p>

            <p><strong>Restricted Areas:</strong> Private spaces (bedrooms, offices) are restricted: being there, even without snooping, 
            triggers immediate confrontation if you're seen. Some rooms have hiding spots, but they aren't one button escapes, you 
            need to spot them early and reach them quickly to avoid being caught.</p>

            <p><strong>Sound Cues:</strong> Footsteps, voices, and doors provide directional audio. Reading the soundscape 
            helps you decide when to end a search, relocate, or hide.</p>

            <p><strong>Day/Night Cycle:</strong> The investigation spans multiple days. Day/night shifts change who is present 
            and where they can be found, opening and closing windows of access.</p>

            <p><strong>Progression & Ending:</strong> As days pass, you piece together the truth and uncover the bodies of your mother, 
            father, and brother. You're then prompted to escape. After tense, quiet maneuvers, a final chase erupts; you narrowly 
            break free as the house burns with the family trapped inside, a tragic ending, as not everyone deserved it.</p>
