    <h3>Who I Am</h3>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Teo, born and raised in Berkeley, California, where beach days were common and sunscreen was usually an afterthought. 
        I take snacks seriously: the good ones live in plain sight—technically not hidden, easy to reach, somehow hard to see. 
        I like long, easy conversations and small adjustments that make things better one step at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not at my desk working, I'm usually out on a late night walk with friends, especially in summer, when the cold night time breeze turns stories into permanent inside jokes. 
        I care a lot about balance, knowing when to let loose and when to focus is something that I try to get a little bit better at every day.

    <!-- Interests -->
    <section class="project-card">
        <h3>My Interests</h3>

        <p><strong>Running & Lifting:</strong> Time away from work that steadies my mood. Even better with a friend, you can have a good conversation and some laughs, and it still feels productive.</p>

        <p><strong>Cooking & Food Photos:</strong> My Notes app probably has more recipes than actual notes, although I mostly cook by feel at this point. Half the fun is plating (which somehow takes longer than cooking) and snapping a photo.</p>

        <p><strong>Favorite Eats:</strong> I love cooking, but eating wins. A ribeye with a proper sear, tacos of almost any kind, or a classic smash burger with fries, can't beat it.</p>

        <p><strong>Cliff Jumping:</strong> Oregon spoiled me with jump spots. That moment off the edge, especially if you do a flip, is pure adrenaline.</p>

        <p><strong>Hiking & Outdoors:</strong> Long trails, amazing views, and time with people I care about while getting some miles in? Count me in.</p>
