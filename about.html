    <h3>Who I Am</h3>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Teo! Born and raised in Berkeley, California. I take my snacks very seriously, the best ones are “technically” not hidden, easy to reach, but somehow hard to spot. I'm drawn to relaxed conversations and to small, deliberate changes that make things better one step at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not at my desk, I'm usually on a late-night walk with friends, especially during summer, when a cool breeze turns stories into lasting inside jokes. I care about balance; knowing when to relax and when to focus, and getting a little better at both every day.

      <h3>My Interests</h3>

      <p><strong>Running & Lifting:</strong> My reset outside of work. Even better with a friend, good conversation, a few laughs, and it still feels like productive.</p>

      <p><strong>Cooking & Food Photos:</strong> My notes app is full of recipes, though I mostly cook by feel now. Half the fun is plating (somehow takes longer than cooking), and snapping a quick photo.</p>

      <p><strong>Eating:</strong> I love cooking, but eating wins: a ribeye with a proper sear, tacos of almost any kind, or a classic smash burger with fries are hard to beat.</p>

      <p><strong>Cliff Jumping:</strong> Oregon spoiled me with great spots. That moment off the edge, especially with a flip, is pure adrenaline.</p>

      <p><strong>Hiking & Outdoors:</strong> Long trails, big views, and time with people I care about while getting some miles in, always a favorite.</p>

      <p><strong>Drawing:</strong> Currently, I'm taking a drawing class and really enjoying it. I sketch in my free time and plan to bring it into future projects.</p>
