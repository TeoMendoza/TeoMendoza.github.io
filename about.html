    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Teo—currently studying computer science at Willamette University and making games because
      I love the mix of systems, story, and human feeling. I grew up in
      <span class="placeholder">[your hometown or region]</span>, in a home where weekends meant
      family, food, and a slightly chaotic schedule of hobbies. I’m the kind of person who
      overthinks puzzle rules, texts friends about oddly satisfying UI, and gets way too excited
      when a small detail makes something feel real.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the screen, I’m happiest moving—long walks, runs, and gym sessions—then cooking
      something simple (and usually healthier than it looks). I like good conversations, small creative
      projects, and the feeling of chipping away at a difficult thing until it clicks.

    <h2>Things I’m Into</h2>
    <ul class="interests">
      <li>
        <h3>Running & Lifting</h3>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Cooking Experiments</h3>
        <p>Low-key “nutrition nerd.” High-protein desserts, air-fryer science, and better-than-it-should-be breakfasts.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Games as Tiny Worlds</h3>
        <p>I love how rules, art, and sound create meaning—especially when small choices change the vibe.</p>

      <li>
        <h3>Walks & Good Music</h3>
        <p>Head-clearing playlists and long loops around the neighborhood.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Travel Moments</h3>
        <p>New places, cheap coffee, and taking photos that make me want to build new spaces in 3D.</p>
