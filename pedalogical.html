            <h3>My Role in Pedalogical</h3>
            <p>
                I served as project manager during summer development, leading a three-person 
                student team on this NSF-funded research initiative. My focus was on aligning 
                technical work with educational goals and fostering collaboration across 
                developers, researchers, and faculty.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this role, some of my main contributions included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Directing production, setting milestones, and guiding team workflows</li>
                <li>Acting as liaison between the development team and faculty project lead</li>
                <li>Overseeing system redesign efforts to ensure scalability for classroom deployment</li>
                <li>Encouraging cross disciplinary communication and collaboration</li>
                <li>Preparing the project for launch in Fall 2025, supporting 100-150 students</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This role gave me valuable experience in leadership, project organization, and 
                translating big-picture vision into actionable progress across a complex team project.
