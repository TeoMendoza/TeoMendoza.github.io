            <h3>My Role in Pedalogical</h3>
            <p>
                I served as project manager during summer development, leading a three person 
                student team on this NSF-funded research initiative. My focus was on aligning 
                technical work with educational goals and fostering collaboration among 
                developers, researchers, and faculty. My key contributions included:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Directing production, setting milestones, and guiding team workflows</li>
                <li>Acting as liaison between the development team and the faculty project lead</li>
                <li>Overseeing system redesigns to ensure scalability for classroom deployment</li>
                <li>Encouraging cross-disciplinary communication and collaboration</li>
                <li>Preparing the platform for Spring 2025 launch, supporting ~150 students</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                This role gave me valuable experience in leadership, project organization, and 
                translating big picture vision into actionable progress across a complex team project.
