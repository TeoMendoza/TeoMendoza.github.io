            <h3>Pedalogical</h3>
            <p>
                Pedalogical is an educational platform that leverages AI to 
                support both students and instructors. It provides guided learning 
                experiences, personalized feedback, and tools for instructors to 
                analyze student progress and adapt their teaching.

            <h3>My Role in Pedalogical</h3>
            <p>
                As project manager, I led the summer development of Pedalogical and coordinated a 
                three person student team as part of an NSF-funded research initiative. I worked closely 
                with our faculty lead to translate educational research goals into concrete design and 
                development tasks, ensuring consistent progress across technical and pedagogical fronts.

            <ul class="indented-list">
                <li>Directed production and workflow, setting milestones and guiding implementation cycles</li>
                <li>Acted as liaison between faculty lead and the development team, aligning goals and execution</li>
                <li>Oversaw the redesign of core features to support scalability and classroom deployment</li>
                <li>Guided development of analytics and insight systems to track student learning patterns</li>
                <li>Contributed to UX improvements including a new navigation flow and cleaner UI design</li>
                <li>Collaborated on infrastructure improvements, preparing the project for launch in Fall 2025 
                    to support 100-150 students across multiple disciplines</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This experience gave me hands-on leadership in managing a cross-functional project, 
                balancing research requirements with design, technical development, and long-term vision.
